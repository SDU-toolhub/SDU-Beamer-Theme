## Usage

1.  If your software environment is not ready, go check this [LaTeX installation document](https://mirror.macomnet.net/pub/CTAN/info/install-latex-guide-zh-cn/install-latex-guide-zh-cn.pdf) by *Wang Ran* or this [LaTeX tutorial by SUSTech](https://niko.cra.moe/uploads/short-url/9a47N0ThHXRb6em95R7422y8v7b.pdf).
2.  Some basic LaTeX grammar rules are also included in the documents above. If you have any problem, Google it first and it always help.
3.  Clone this repository and you can modify it!

Tips: The file format of the slides generated by LaTeX Beamer is `pdf`, thus sometimes incompatible with some courses' requirements of SDU, which requires `ppt / pptx` files most of the time. So give [pdf2pptx](https://github.com/intMojIBakE/pdf2pptx) or [BeamerStyleSlides](https://github.com/wzpan/BeamerStyleSlides) a try!

At the beginning of `slide.tex`, there are the following configurations:

```latex
% Font settings
\usepackage{fontspec} % Font selection
\usepackage{xeCJK} % Chinese font support

% Set Chinese fonts
\setCJKsansfont[AutoFakeBold]{LXGW WenKai}
\setCJKmainfont{LXGW WenKai}
\setCJKmonofont{Sarasa Mono SC}

% Set English fonts
\setmainfont{Times New Roman} % Main font
\setsansfont{Arial} % Sans-serif font
```

You usually need to modify these settings according to your needs. If using Linux, you can view the installed fonts on your system with the `fc-list` command, or `fc-list :lang=zh` to find Chinese fonts.

---

For Visual Studio Code users, if you prefer not to install `TeXstudio`, you can use the `LaTeX Workshop` extension to write LaTeX directly in VS Code.

Find and modify the following configurations in `Settings.json`:

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
    {
        "name": "biber",
        "command": "biber",
        "args": [
            "%DOCFILE%"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "xelatex",
        "command": "xelatex",
        "args": [
            "-synctex=1",
            "-interaction=nonstopmode",
            "%DOC%"
        ],
    },
    ……
],

"latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
    {
        "name": "xelatex -> biber -> xelatex",
        "tools": [
            "xelatex",
            "biber",
            "xelatex",
        ]
    },
    ……
]
```

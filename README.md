## Usage

1.   If your software environment is not ready, go check this [LaTeX installation document](https://mirror.macomnet.net/pub/CTAN/info/install-latex-guide-zh-cn/install-latex-guide-zh-cn.pdf) by *Wang Ran* or this [LaTeX tutorial by SUSTech](https://niko.cra.moe/uploads/short-url/9a47N0ThHXRb6em95R7422y8v7b.pdf).
2.   Some basic LaTeX grammar rules are also included in the documents above. If you have any problem, Google it first and it always help.
3.   Clone this repository and you can modify it!

Tips: The file format of the slides generated by LaTeX Beamer is `pdf`, thus sometimes incompatible with some courses' requirements of SDU, which requires `ppt / pptx` files most of the time. So give [pdf2pptx](https://github.com/intMojIBakE/pdf2pptx) or [BeamerStyleSlides](https://github.com/wzpan/BeamerStyleSlides) a try!
